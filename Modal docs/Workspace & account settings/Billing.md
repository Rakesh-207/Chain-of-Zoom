# Billing

Modal is serverless, which means you only pay for the compute you use or [reserve](/docs/guide/resources). Reservations are not required, and there are no minimum usage-time increments. Up-to-date unit pricing for all of our products is available on our [Pricing page](/pricing).

## Billing frequency

All workspaces are billed monthly. At the end of each billing cycle, you are auto-charged for the Modal usage incurred during that cycle (less any credits), as well as any subscription fees (non-Starter plans only) for the following billing cycle.

## Setting a workspace budget

To set limits on how how much Modal usage can be incurred within the monthly billing period, go to the “Workspace budget” section of [Usage and Billing](/settings/usage). The max you can set this limit to is based on the history of prior successful charges to your payment method. Within a billing period, you may be charged for incremental usage when you pass certain thresholds. If those charges are successful, the max cap goes up.

## Updating billing information

To update your billing information, click on “Manage payment information” in the [Usage and Billing](/settings/usage) section of Settings. This will take you to a Stripe-hosted page where you can update your payment method and/or billing email.

## Viewing invoice history

To view your invoice history and/or download receipts, click on “Manage payment information” in the [Usage and Billing](/settings/usage) section of Settings. You should see an “Invoice History” section at the bottom of the Stripe-hosted page.

## Custom invoicing

Invoiced billing, international bank transfer payment methods, and other custom requirements are available to customers on an [Enterprise plan](/pricing) who have a usage commitment with us. Please contact [sales@modal.com](mailto:sales@modal.com).
